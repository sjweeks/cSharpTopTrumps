## Project Profile

Using C#
- This is an initial commit of the Top Trumps game using C#

## How to initialize
- Download - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
- If using VS Code, download the C# extensions

## How to use
- There is a deck which is currently split into two - Deck 1 & Deck 2
- The user is then given the option of which attribute they would like to compare
    - Health
    - Magic
    -Courage
- The console will then let the user know the value of each deck attribute 
- The winning deck will then be informed who won, the losing card will then be moved to the back of the winning deck.

## Areas of Improvement
As this is very early stages of both the project and my C# knowledge there are quite a few improvements to be made
- Looping through the game with the updates to the cards showing
- Adding more cards, with a shuffle function
-
